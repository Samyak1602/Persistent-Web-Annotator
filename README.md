   - Enter your note in the floating input
   - Click "Save" or press Ctrl+Enter

## Storage Schema

Notes are stored in `chrome.storage.local` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-v4",
      "url": "https://example.com/page",
      "content": "User input note",
      "domLocator": {
        "selector": "body > div > p",
        "textOffset": 123,
        "textContent": "selected text"
      },
      "createdAt": 123456789
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permissions

- `storage`: Store notes locally
- `activeTab`: Access current tab information
- `scripting`: Inject content scripts
- `contextMenus`: Add context menu items
- `host_permissions`: Access all URLs for content script injection

## Development Notes

- The content script uses Shadow DOM to isolate React components from page styles
- DOM locators use a hybrid strategy combining CSS selectors with text offsets for reliable restoration
- Highlights are restored automatically when pages load
- The extension works with SPAs (Single Page Applications) by monitoring DOM changes
